# CS252 Graphing Assignment

Try running graphs.py ("python3 graphs.py" at the command-line or just executing graphs.py in VS Code ought to do the job). Does the output match your expectations?
Implement the bfs_tree, dfs_tree, and topological_sort methods of the Graph class.
Submit your copy of graphs.py with the three newly implemented methods. If you add tests to the main program, make sure to also submit any new dot files that your tests use.
